# AI Vehicle Classifier

A short assignment to learn how AI works using Google Teachable AI.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to classify vehicles through image recognition. The assignment leverages Google's Teachable Machine to create and train a simple AI model that can distinguish between different types of vehicles.

## Features

- Uses Google Teachable Machine for model training and export
- JavaScript implementation for running the classifier in-browser
- Example web page for testing vehicle classification
- Hosted with GitHub Pages: [Live Demo](https://gabi-r7.github.io/AI-Vehicle-Classifier/)

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Main programming language for the project
- **Google Teachable Machine**: Used for training the classification model
- **HTML/CSS**: For the user interface and styling
